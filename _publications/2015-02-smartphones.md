### About this work
This paper was my first reseeach attempt during high school and continued to my first year at university. As I am considered as part of the [Z Generation](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007224353/https://www.businessinsider.com/generation-z) where the explosion of smartphone usage and the increase of instant-messaging apps happened during our teenage development. I was interested in the question of what motivates us to be heavily connected to our phones. During my high school, I created a survey based on the literature, and when I joined my university, I approached Dr. Lee McCallum to help me in structuring the paper and Dr. Tasnim Ali to help me in statistical analysis.

### Findings
In comparison to the world high school students, students in Saudi Arabia share the same strong and weak motivations and the same number of hours spent on a smart phone.
